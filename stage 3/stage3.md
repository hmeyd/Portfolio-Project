#  5. Plan SCM and QA Strategies
## SCM Strategy

### 1. Version Control System:
Tool: Git
Hosting: GitHub

Main Branch (main): Production-ready code only
Feature Branches (feature): Created from dev for individual tasks or features.
### 3. Code Management:

Regular Commits: Commit changes frequently with descriptive messages.
Pull Requests (or Merge requests):
Every feature/hotfix branch must be merged through a merger application.
At least one code reviewer must approve before merging.
Code Reviews:
Focus on code quality, performance, readability, and security.
Use templates and checklists to ensure consistency.
## QA Strategy

### 1. Types of Tests:

Unit Tests: For individual functions/components (example with Jest )
Integration Tests: Ensure modules interact correctly (example with Postman)
Manual Testing: For critical paths, exploratory testing, or UI validations.

### 2. Testing Tools:

Jest: For unit testing JavaScript/TypeScript code.
Postman: For API integration testing.
ESLint : For code linting and formatting.
